faruqi_empire_title;The Legacy of Khandesh;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
faruqi_empire_desc;Khandesh, "Land of the Khans", was established in the 14th century when Malik Ahmad revolted against the old Bahmanid Empire. While only a minor territory of little note in its early days, the Faruqi Dynasty has managed to expand Khandesh at the expanse of the old Malwa Sultanate. Strategically located in central India, the Faruqids managed to fight off the resurgent Delhi Sultanate twice, preserving the independence of Khandesh for centuries. With the recent demise of the Sultanate, the time has come to lead Khandesh into a new age of glory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
faruqia_title;Abolish Gwalior and Rewa;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
faruqia_desc;The Princely States of Gwalior and Rewa seceded from the crumbling Delhi Sultanate in the early 19th century. Minor states with little legitimacy, we should abolish these titles for good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
become_egypt_title;Reform the Sultanate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
become_egypt_desc;The Mamluk Sultanate has a long history reaching from an era of unquestioned hegemony and eventual stagnation to an unprecedented resurgence. Throughout all this time, Cairo remained unconquered, Egypt is our home. It is only fitting to reform the Sultanate into a proper Egyptian state, less defined by who rules it but rather by what it is. We shall adopt the official name of the Sultanate of Egypt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
adopt_standard_italian_title;Italian Language Policy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
adopt_standard_italian_desc;With standard Italian having become widespread throughout most of Italy and with the increasing nationalist sentiment throughout the peninsula, we should decide our future linguistic policy to settle the matter once and for all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pnj_unites_the_sikh_title;Unite the Misls;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pnj_unites_the_sikh_desc;In the aftermath of the Delhi Sultanate's demise, the Sikhs in the Punjab mobilized and organized themselves into various communal armies, the so-called Misls. Under the leadership of the Sukerchakia, the Misls have successfully occupied Amritsar, Attock and Lahore, the ever glorious confederacy now stronger than ever. The time has come to truly unite all Sikhs under one banner and carry the true faith into the world!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pnj_invades_peshawar_title;Invade Peshawar;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pnj_invades_peshawar_desc;The realms in the west are slowly dying, blinded by their own greed they have overextended themselves and now suffer the consequences for it. It is our chance to seize the mountain passes and tribal lands to secure our frontier against the Afghans. No longer shall any Pashtun power threaten our beautiful Punjab!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pnj_claims_greater_ladakh_title;The North-Eastern Frontier;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pnj_claims_greater_ladakh_desc;The Celestrial Empire is failing. Anarchy is spreading in Kashgaria and we must act quickly to secure our frontier!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
abolish_bahawalpur_title;Exile the Abbasi Khan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
abolish_bahawalpur_desc;The Abbasi Clan has ruled the strategically located town of Bahawalpur since the middle of the 17th century. With the demise of the Delhi Sultanate, the Khans assumed independence entirely, threatening trade in the area and launching raids into the surrounding lands. With our conquest of the state, the time has come to exile the Abbasi and abolish Bahawalpur once and for all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
unite_the_rajputs_title;Unite the Rajputs;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
unite_the_rajputs_desc;The lands of Rajputana have fallen into a state of anarchy and civil war when the recent Delhi Sultanate collapsed. With a new force rising from Gaya in the east and from Punjab in the north, we must unite our brethren and mobilize the might of the Rajputs not only secure our independence but preserve Hindustan from certain barbarism as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
unite_the_lunda_title;Form the Lunda State;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
unite_the_lunda_desc;The various Lunda states of the Chokwe and Kazambe have been divided for too long. With our new position as Hegemon over the southern steppes, we can unite the tribes and form a united Lunda State to secure a legacy for our people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

welsh_schooling_act_title;Anglish Schooling Act;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
welsh_schooling_act_desc;"It is evident to all of us that the language of the Angles and Saxons is one of peasants, a language that is unable to insure communication even with the neighbouring village, incapable of expressing the modern world, a language only good enough to talk to cows and pigs. It is thus the duty of the state to teach those poor peasants a civilized tongue, to help eradicate this language that is a burden and the source of so much humiliation and shame, to integrate them so that they too may benefit from the prosperity that our nation enjoys. Thus we say: Dim Saesneg!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
integrate_the_english_title;Embrace the Angles;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
integrate_the_english_desc;"The Angles were always an integral part of the British nation. We must not forgot their part, for it was the Anglishman who joined us in the rightful reconquest of the Danelag, for it was the Anglishman who joined us in the unification of the isles, for it was the Anglishman who fought and died at Calais for the greater good of the British nation. Without the effort and blood of our Germanic brothers, we would've have fallen to the barbarism of the Franks and Norse a long time ago, thus, independent of their tongue, they've earned the right to be treated as equals in the nation of all free men, the grand and glorious Nation of Prydain";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kyo_centralize_government_title;Unite the Khanate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kyo_centralize_government_desc;The Mongol state of Kyoto has prevailed for many centuries, even outliving the mighty Yuan. Being the last heir of the once grand Mongol Empire, it is fully upon us to restore the order of Dschinghis Khan. We have to enact the necessary reforms to centralize our Khanate and put our country on a path of prosperity and greatness if we want the Mongol legacy to last.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
form_ezo_title;Unite the Ainu;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
form_ezo_desc;The Ainu people are the last aboriginals of Japan and probably trace their lineage all the way back to the ancient Jomon. Originally inhabiting the lands all the way south to Kyushu, the Ainu were gradually pushed north by the old Yamato before eventually consolidating the lands of Ezo. Following the Mongol Invasion of Japan, the Ainu regained their foothold on Honshu, but the newly reformed Emishi were quick to fall under the Hojo Dominion, splitting the Ainu into two rivaling states. We must reunite with our kinsmen if we want to reclaim the country from the Yamato and Mongols.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
form_silesia_title;A New Silesia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
form_silesia_desc;Silesia was a Slavic land first and foremost. Wasn't it for the Mongols and the constant Polish-Bohemian warfare that saw our homeland was a battleground between these states, the Eastern Settlement would have never led to the germanization of much of our homeland. We must restore the old Slavic Silesian identity and reunite lower and upper silesia into a single state!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
support_lithuanian_nobles_title;The Matter of Lithuania;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
support_lithuanian_nobles_desc;In the aftermath of the Lithuanian Crusade, the majority of Trakai and Lithuania proper were annexed by the ever growing Teutonic State. But unlike in Estonia and Baltia, the already christianized Lithuanians retained many privileges and in recent times have repeatedly revolted against the German Yoke. Unable to free themselves, we could offer our support to the Baltic Lithuanian Nobility in exchange for special concessions in case of their victory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
form_cir_title;Unite the Cherkess Tribes;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
form_cir_desc;The Cherkess Tribes, also known as Adyghe or Circassians, have inhabited the North-Western Caucasus for millenia and have a long history ruling various local kingdoms and khanates along with mighty empires like the Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt. In the past century, the Kabarda have increasingly fallen under Kalmyk Dominion while the Abkhaz have steadily fallen under Persian and Kartvelian influence. While Adygea has managed to fight off Mongol, Cossack and Iranian aggression, the time has come to unite the three nations into a single Circassian nationstate to ensure our continued existence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
form_cmw_title;The Polish-Ruthenian Commonwealth;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
form_cmw_desc;Since the 15th century, Poland has gradually expanded eastward and came to include various duchies and principalities of the former Kievan Rus. By now, the lands known as Ruthenia and Poland have become closely integrated with one another and have become almost inseparable. By ensuring the equality between Ruthenians and Poles, we strengthen this ancestral union and ensure the continued unity of Poland-Ruthenia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
build_odessa_title;Found Chadzybej;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
build_odessa_desc;The Ukrainian Steppes remain a sparsely populated and heavily contested land. Crimeans, Russians, Persians and various Steppe Peoples all desire the vast and fertile lands, causing the borders in the region to shift periodically. The small black sea port of Moldavanka in the south is currently our only access point to the southern sea but is primarily inhabited by Tatars, Ruthenians and Romanians, thus some of our leading architects and advisors have put forth the proposal to found a new settlement in the area with the goal of solidifying our rule over the steppe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
form_nazirid_empire_title;Declare the Nazirid Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
form_nazirid_empire_desc;Iran is in anarchy - Thanks to our recently won independence, we remain as a strong beacon of stability in the region, free from foreign rule. With the fall of the Hajilarids, various heretical Shiite states have emerged throughout the former empire, thus it is our duty to extend our rule over all of Iran, to carry the name and banner of Naziri all the way to Tabriz and beyond!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
afghanistan_back_formation_title;Become Afghanistan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
afghanistan_back_formation_desc;While the initial Nazirid Revolt has failed, we have still managed to gain our independence from the Persians, thus it is only fitting to rename our country in celebration of this new fact.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
form_afghan_emirate_title;Become Afghanistan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
form_afghan_emirate_desc;The Nazirid Emirate, named after Iqbal Naziri, the father of our nation, is seen by many as a feudal islamic backwater. However, with our recent reforms we have managed to catch up to most of the world and with our independence secured it is only fitting to officially change the name of our country to reflect our progress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
form_the_swahili_federation_title;Unite the Swahili Coast;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
form_the_swahili_federation_desc;The Swahili Coast stretches from southern Somalia all the way down to Sofala and is primarily controlled by various Swahili Sultanates. With cities like Zanzibar, Mombasa and Sofala serving as major centers for the East African Slave Trade, the region has become extremely wealthy but remains divided in spite of the growing Arabic and European influence. We have to take it upon ourselves to unite the various states under a single banner to fight off any attempts of foreign colonialization.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
form_the_yoruba_federation_title;Unite the Yoruba;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
form_the_yoruba_federation_desc;The various Yoruba city states and kingdoms remain divided in spite of the ever growing influence of outside powers. An increase of jihadist raids in the north as well as growing european influence in the region shows that we must take up the mantle of hegemon and unite our people to preserve our independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
form_kds_title;Neither Persian nor Dimili, Her Kurd Ebîn;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
form_kds_desc;Foreign invaders have occupied our lands for centuries. Persians, Turks, Zaza, Arabs and Mongols - All foreigners who have tried and failed to assimilate the Kurdish nation. While our people remain high in spirit and conscious, most of our lands remain occupied - However, the Crisis of the Rum and decline of the Afsharids can be our oppertunity to assert our independence and liberate all Kurds under a single banner. Onwards united as a free and united Kurdistan!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
end_trebizond_revolt_title;Conclude the North-Eastern Campaign;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
end_trebizond_revolt_desc;The Ionian Revolt in the larger Pontus area has successfully been put down. The majority of the rebel leaders have been captured and all cities have come under Imperial rule once more. Let us conclude the successful offensive and reintegrate the area into our realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
claim_sicilia_title;Reclaim Sicily;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
claim_sicilia_desc;The Sicilian Lands were historically part of the Crown of Aragón, however, with the Union of the Spanish Thrones these territories were inherited by the King of León. Following the recent revolutionary wars in Hispania, the Mediterranean and Sicilian Lands seceded entirely - due to this, we were unable to regain them following our renewed independence. It is time to right this wrong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
reapers_rise_title;La Renaixença;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
reapers_rise_desc;The Crown of Aragón is free once more. Centuries of Spanish Rule have come to an end and it's time to decide the future course of our new nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
rigan_future_title;The Future of Riga;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
rigan_future_desc;The Baltenland is no more. The Lithuanians and Livonians have dismantled the prosperous League and left us limited to the city of Riga. While we take a part of the blame, the lack of aid from our Hanseatic 'Allies' is also a major reason for this outcome. Either way, it is time to pick a future course for our young republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
form_tajikistan_native_title;Unite the Tajiks;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
form_tajikistan_native_desc;The regions of Bactria, Sogdia and Chorasmia have been divided for too long. Ever since the Mongols invaded our lands have been ruled by foreigners or warlords, destroying our ancient heritage and culture. The time has come for the Tajiks to restore order and unite under one banner to preserve our independence and become a defender of Persian culture in central asia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
form_tajik_empire_title;The Chorasmid Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
form_tajik_empire_desc;Iran has fallen into anarchy. The collapse of the Afsharids has led to the rise of various pretenders across the whole empire, leaving us weak to foreign invaders. It is clear that none of these warlords has the means to reunite the whole of Iran so it comes down to us, the heirs of Khwarazm to march south and return order to the land. A new dynasty shall rise from the north, a new Chorasmid Empire!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
al_biruni_university_unciv_title;The al-Biruni University;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
al_biruni_university_unciv_desc;Abu Rayhan al-Biruni was an Iranian scholar and polymath during the Islamic Golden Age. He has been variously called as the "founder of Indology", "Father of Comparative Religion", "Father of modern geodesy", and the first anthropologist. Our ownership over his ancestral homeland of Chorasmia gives us the unique option to dedicate a university to his great name and which would be the first of its kind in all of greater Iran.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

the_magyars_flee_title;The Great Magyar Migration;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
the_magyars_flee_desc;Repeated attacks by the Russians in the past have proved unsuccessful and while they never managed to fully subjugate us, their campaigns and acts of terror have left much of the wider Kazan area devastated. It becomes clear that the area is no longer a viable homeland and many of our kinsmen have already left for good. We shall follow them south into a new homeland, away from the ever growing russian tsardom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
the_green_khan_title;The Zöld Khan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
the_green_khan_desc;Under the leadership of the Green Khan we have finally managed to escape the russians and settle in a new homeland around the crimean lands. But our land is small and we will have to expand if we want to build ourselves a truly modern nation. We will have to reconcile with the poles and learn from them if we want to survive in this new environment and persist into the modern age.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
aachen_reforms_francia_title;Charlemagne's Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
aachen_reforms_francia_desc;So many centuries have passed since the grand empire was dissolved. The Franks have been divided and forgotten. The realm that gave birth to the nations of the Germans, French and Italians seems like a distant memory now. But Aachen still remains. From the homeland of the old Franks, we shall once more unite all of europe under one banner, once more reform the Kingdom of the Franks. Regnum Francorum Aeterna!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lander_reform_title;Bundeslandreform;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lander_reform_desc;The Bundeslandreform, or "Federal Country Reform", was proposed in the aftermath of the Belgian Revolution in an attempt to reform the administration of the Empire. It is clear that we have lost control in a lot of regions, causing anarchy and revolutionary ideals to spread like wildfires. If we want to keep the empire together, we will have to reassert our authority across the entire realm - by establishing federal countries that are ruled directly by our bureaucrats we will take a decent first step towards centralizing the empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
yue_occupies_guangxi_title;Occupy Guangxi;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
yue_occupies_guangxi_desc;The Zhou Emperor is weak. Earthquakes, floodings, raids and invasions, inability to defeat the Ming - all of these are signs that the Zhou Mandate is illegitimate. Let us show to the other feudatories that indeed, the Zhou can do nothing to oppose their enemies!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
yue_reforms_lingnan_proposal_title;The Lingnan Proposal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
yue_reforms_lingnan_proposal_desc;The feudatory of Jiaozhi occupies the territory of northern Yuenan, a territory that was historically closely connected to the lands of the Pearl River. Oh how long has it been since the days of Nanyue, how long have the lands of Lingnan been divided. It is time to reform our ancient state!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
yue_becomes_yue_title;Form the Great Yue Dynasty;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
yue_becomes_yue_desc;The Zhou have fallen. Their Mandate is illegitimate. China is on the brink of civil strife and conflict, a new Manchu state is threatening to conquer all of the Middle Kingdom. The Zhou will not be able to defend it, but we will. Long live the Great Yue!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
move_cap_to_vienna_title;Towards Vienna;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
move_cap_to_vienna_desc;While Graz has been the capital of Styria for the past two centuries, it is relatively small and undeveloped compared to Vienna. Due to its strategic location on the Danube and the generous development by both the Babenberger and Habsburger Houses, the city is one of the largest within the Holy Roman Empire. Thus we should relocate court and government to Vienna and solidify our rule over the Austrian Duchy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
relocate_back_to_conpol_title;Relocate back to Qenstantanwpewl;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
relocate_back_to_conpol_desc;With the Ionian Revolt put down we should now move the court and government back to Qenstantanwpewl due to its strategic location.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ana_sultan_reforms_title;The Shah's Reform;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ana_sultan_reforms_desc;The recent revolts have shown us that that our Sultanate is rotten to the core. As a result, the Shah has summoned the highest state officials and initiated a series of reforms that aim at modernizing the Ruman Sultanate. The first wave of reforms shall be aimed at creating a new identity from the ground up, embrace our Anatolian heritage and reform our administration to more effectively administer our territories.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
seize_macedonia_title;Seize Macedonia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
seize_macedonia_desc;The ancient region of Macedon to our north-west has been cut off from the rest of the Sultanate. We must seize the oppertunity and take control of the area by all means necessary!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
brit_centralization_act_title;The Second Centralization Act;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
brit_centralization_act_desc;The Centralization Act was first proposed in 1787 and attempted to end the autonomy for the various dukes in Prydain. While largely implenented, the Duke of Brynaich, due to his history as King of the former Northumbria and his connection to the Kingdom of Ystrad Clud, has been excluded from the first bill along with the British overseas territory of Iwerddon. However, as the industrialization progresses, the more obselete do these titles become. We must remove these archaic feudal structures once and for all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
invite_liege_into_usn_title;Invite Liége;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
invite_liege_into_usn_desc;The Republic of Liége was the first in the Netherlands to overthrow the Imperial yoke. Wasn't it for these brave republicans, much of the netherlands would still be under the rule of Munich. Now that we have followed their example and established a federation of republics, it only makes sense to invite them into the union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
invite_brabant_into_usn_title;Invite Brabant;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
invite_brabant_into_usn_desc;While the Duchy of Brabant may be a monarchy, its rulers have shown in the past they have embraced the ideals of the enlightenment. Furthermore, unlike many other kingdoms and duchies within the empire, the brabantians have their own written constitution and have shown great support for the liberals of our age, granting them asylum in these dire times. With enough pressure, we can "motivate" them to join our federation and promise them a certain degree of autonomy within the union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
invite_holland_into_usn_title;Invite Holland;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
invite_holland_into_usn_desc;Many would regard Holland as the birthplace of the netherlandish identity. Its vast colonial holdings and strong economy have brought them great wealth and luxury while many other areas of the netherlands have been under the feudal yoke of the nobility and clergy. The merchants of Holland have undermined the dukes to such a degree that, indeed, many would consider Holland to be the first republic of the netherlands. As part of the Hanseatic League, Holland did not have to fear any serious response from the emperor in munich. However, with their secession from the League, they are now vulnerable to reactionaries and  it only makes sense to offer them our protection within the union to mutually aid each other in these dire times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
invite_utrecht_into_usn_title;Invite Utrecht;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
invite_utrecht_into_usn_desc;Utrecht, like many other territories within the empire, has come under the direct rule of the emperor a long time ago. As part of the United Territories of Berg-Jülich-Kleve-Utrecht, they have developed a strong distaste of the Rhenish and Bavarians and would eagerly join our union to secure their newly won independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
form_the_usn_title;De Verenigde Nederlandse Staten;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
form_the_usn_desc;The Imperial Netherlands have collapsed. Instead various de-facto independent republics have emerged, all with the same goal of spreading the ideals of the Spanish Revolution. However, divided we are weak and it's unlikely that we will survive too long on our own. We should put forth a proposal to the others to join a federation of the low countries, a vanguard that shall lead the liberal and like-minded states of the empire towards a unified German state free of Emperors and Kings!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
restore_jerusalem_title;The Kingdom of Jerusalem;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
restore_jerusalem_desc;Five centuries have passed since we were driven out of the Holy Land. Five centuries of humiliation for all of Christianity. While many have come to recognize the muslim rule over the Holy City, we have not. Jerusalem shall once more be in christian hands, once more shall the holy banner fly above the city. The Kingdom of Jerusalem is eternal for God wills it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mon_claims_burma_title;The Road to Ava;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mon_claims_burma_desc;The Irrawaddy River Valley stands divided as ever. Since the collapse of the ancient Pagan Empire, city states rose and fell, all unable to reunite the once grand empire. While the idea of a unified irrawaddy state appears jingoist these days, without a united state the various irrawaddy kingdoms will fall to foreign powers one by one. We must claim the valley and bring Ava under our rule and then unite the rest of the country!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mon_claims_thailand_title;Reclaim our Homeland;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mon_claims_thailand_desc;The loss of our northern frontier has proven that we will never be able to unite the irrawaddy valley. However, instead of trying to establish a new homeland in the north, we can look towards our old homeland in the east - we must drive out the Thai invaders and re-estblish ourselves in Dvaravati to ensure the survival of the mon nation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
claim_irrawady_delta_title;Claim the Irrawaddy Delta;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
claim_irrawady_delta_desc;The pity Monic state of Hanthawaddy to our south is a shell of its former self. A puppet to French influence, it is a potential danger to our survival if we do not eliminate it soon. We must bring the entire Irrawaddy under our rule, reclaim the coastal lands and then go on and unite the rest of the country under the Bamar flag!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
form_burma_title;Form the Irrawaddy Nation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
form_burma_desc;The Irrawaddy Nation is ethnically quite diverse. While the Bamars dominate the North, the Mons domiante the South and the Thais the East. Putting a single people in charge of it all is by far not the wisest move to ensure long-lasting stability. We must unite all these peoples under the flag of an anti-imperialist irrawaddy nation if we ever desire to maintain our beloved independence!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pnj_save_the_burning_world_title;Save the Burning World;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pnj_save_the_burning_world_desc;Consumed by greed the world is burning and dying - while burning, it cries in agony. If it meets with the soothing Lord, it will not burn any more. O Nanak, without Naam and without contemplating the Word, one cannot become fearless. It is our duty to spread the word and extinguish the flames that consume our beloved world!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
reform_lan_xang_title;Reform Lan Xang;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
reform_lan_xang_desc;The Laotian Kingdom of Lan Xang has existed from 1353–1707 and marked an era of peace and property in the region. However, succession disputes, peasant uprisings and warfare with its neighbours have increasingly destabilized the kingdom over the decades, leading to its end in 1707. Lan Xang was divided and the kingdoms of Luang Prabang and Vientiane emerged. In 1713 the Kingdom of Champasak emerged after a rebellion against Vientiane. Following the division, the situation only worsened for the successor states and they all remain easy pickings for the ever growing Siamese Empire. We must reunite Lan Xang and assert our independence once more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
khmur_unites_laos_title;The Khmu Ambitions;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
khmur_unites_laos_desc;With the Kingdom of Vientiane overthrown it is now our duty to liberate our fellow Katuic and Khmu brothers in the other Lao Kingdoms of Luang Prabang and Champassak. Should we able to unite the various Austroasiatic tribes under our leadership, we can solidify our position as the dominant force of Laos and by extension in all of Indochina.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
khmur_claims_mekong_title;The Khmur Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
khmur_claims_mekong_desc;With our state solidified and in control of all of Laos it is time to expand our boundraries further. The pity kingdom of Cambodia to our south is inhabited by our distant Khmer cousins, however, they have failed to protect our ancestral homeland from the Vietnamese and Thai invaders. We must take control of the Mekong Delta and integrate our Khmer brethren into our realm if we want to ensure the continuation of the Austroasiatics in Indochina.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
laos_claims_mekong_title;Claim the Mekong Delta;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
laos_claims_mekong_desc;With Laos firmly under our control the pity kingdoms abolished, we are know effectively having control over the entire upper Mekong River. However, to our south the pathetic kingdom of cambodia still clinges on what is left of its old empire. The time has come to end the Khmer once and for all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
occupy_montferrat_title;Occupy Montferrat;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
occupy_montferrat_desc;The tyrannical rulers of our nation have been toppled, but our work is far from done: our peninsula is still divided in reactionary domains, which daily strangle the liberties of their subjects. One of these is the Duchy of Montferrat. While the inhabitants of this tiny state are not strong enough to depose their autocratic rulers, we are, and must use this strength to liberate them in our newly founded Second Ambrosian Republic!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
claim_brittany_title;Hawlio Breizh;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
claim_brittany_desc;Following the Anglo-Saxon invasion, many britons fled across the channel and into what would later become Brittany. The duchy would fall under French rule in the 16th century however, ending Breton independence. Seeing the French as occupiers, we can claim the area and present ourselves as liberators of our fellow countrymen across the channel and form a greater Brythonic Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;

aromanian_schools_title;Establish Aromanian Schools;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
aromanian_schools_desc;Our fellow Aromanians are scattered across the balkans, living under the rule of foreign nations. However, there is a large concentration of them in Epirus. While many are iliterate and docile peasants, sending a proposal to the current government to establish local schools for them could lead to a rise of nationalism and with enough subversion, even lead to the creation of an Aromanian state. While these are still far-fetched dreams, establishing schools in the area might benefit both of them and us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
dissolve_illyria_title;Dissolve Illyria;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
dissolve_illyria_desc;Bosnia is no longer part of our domain, thus limiting us to the historical region of Croatia and Slavonia. Should abolish the united kingdom and return to our Croatian roots.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
spread_illyrian_movement_title;Expand the Illyrian Movement;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
spread_illyrian_movement_desc;The Illyrian Movement arose in the early 19th century as a pan-South-Slavist cultural and political movement with the goal of uniting the various South Slavic peoples under a common "Illyrian" flag. While this movement greatly impacted the politics of Croatia and Bosnia, Serbia does reject these ideals, clinging to their old "Serbian" traditions. However, with the rising nationalism across europe it becomes clear that the unification of the Illyrians is merely a matter of time, especially if we encourage the movement abroad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;

claim_serbocroatia_ill_desc;At last the Serbs have embraced the pan-South-Slavic Illyrian ideals. The Serbian government has shown its interest in a possible political unification - we should send a proposl that would immediately merge our both kingdoms under the Illyrian monarchy, giving us a legitimate claim to the entirety of the Serbian state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
claim_serbocroatia_ser_title;Claim Serbocroatia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
claim_serbocroatia_ser_title;The Illyrian Kingdom under Croatian leadership has failed. They were unable to hold their country together, thus many assumed that a united South Slavic state would simply be unfeasable - But Serbia has not fallen yet. We shall pick up the torch left behind by the Illyrians and lead the South Slavs towards a new nation state, one that will finally unite all of us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
avaria_claims_basin_title;The Avar Awakening;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
avaria_claims_basin_desc;Avaria, the land that stretches from the realm of the Germans to that of the Vlachs, from the mighty Danube in the south to the Carpathians in the north, has been subdued and divided ever since the Franks and Bulgars invaded our realm. Petty Kingdoms like Pannonia, Nytra and the Banate now occupy the lands that were once ruled by our Khanate. Humiliated and defeated, we faced centuries of foreign rule in our native Avarian lands. But we Avars have not forgotten our roots. The banner of the Khanate shall once more fly across the entire Pannonian basin, once more shall we be united under a single Khan. The rebirth of Avaria has begun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
bohemian_language_title;The Linguistic Issue;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
bohemian_language_desc;The Bohemian Crown includes various territories that are rather diverse. While German is the sole official language and the language of the ruling and educated classes, the local Avaro-Czecho-Slovak or Slavenian language is spoken by the vast majority of the peasentry and eastern urban population who see it as the "true" language of the bohemian crown. The debate has escalated recently and now threatens to tear our very homeland apart if it remains unresolved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
the_ussr_title;Form the Soviet Union;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
the_ussr_desc;The old regime is no more. The workers have prevailed and the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic now firmly controls what is left of the old empire. However, we and many of our neighbors are severely weakened from the chaos that engulfed our lands. We must unite with our neighboring allies and sign a treaty of union that would unite all socialist countries into a single Soviet Union!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
integrate_themes_mre_title;Integrate the Themes;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
integrate_themes_mre_desc;With the Imperial authority restored and the Ionian off-spring in morea being completely crushed, it becomes clear that our nation is in dire need of reform. Many in the royal court blame the excessive decentralization and autonomy of the themes for the current situation, proposing to radically reform it. By placing the themes under direct imperial rule, we might be able to better administrate our empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
integrate_themes_gre_title;Federalize the Themes;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
integrate_themes_gre_desc;The Revolution was successful and greece is finally united - at least on paper. In reality, the themes still hold significant power and are largely independent. We should reform the theme system and reinforce the authority of the new parliament. By offering each theme a number of seats, we can eliminate the need for locally appointed rulers and fully democratize greece in one go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
pikchunic_government_selection_title;On Our Own;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
pikchunic_government_selection_desc;The unbelievable has happened: The Spanish Crown is no more. The authority of the viceroy is no longer legitimate and without any signs of outside help it appears that we're fighting a hopeless war. The Colombians keep on advancing and our nation is on the brink of civil war. We must take drastic measures if we want to survive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
form_the_alpenland_title;Proclaim the Alpland;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
form_the_alpenland_desc;As the Bavarian Empire declines, our power grows. With the Alpine nations de facto independent we should go forth and offer the others to join us in a federation of equals to strengthen our position and establish our independence from the rest of the HRE.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
form_the_kongsi_federation_title;The Kongsi Federation;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
form_the_kongsi_federation_desc;The area of western borneo has been settled by Hakka and Yue miners for a few decades now. Due to the hardship and hostility of the area, the various communities formed the so-called Kongsi Republics that guaranteed mutual cooperation, decentralized authority and a democratic organization of the various mining cooperatives. With our new dominant position amongst the kongsi we can now unite the republics into a single federation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
cam_end_of_dark_age_title;End the Dark Age;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
cam_end_of_dark_age_desc;The old Khmer Empire saw a steady decline for many centuries, eventually leading to the Dark ages of Cambodia which roughly began in the 15th century. History saw us lose many of our historic territories to the invading Thai peoples as well as the Viet state of Da Nang. However, with our newly won strength the time has come to reclaim our lands and to re-emerge as a powerful empire. No longer shall the Khmer be subject to foreign empires!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
claim_iraq_title;Reclaim Iraq;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
claim_iraq_desc;Mesopotamia is often regarded as the birth cradle of civilization. It has always been a contested area between great empires, especially in recent history. With the fall of the Sassanid Empire, the entire Levant and Mashriq fell into Arab hands, only to be changed once the mongols invaded. However, with our newly won strength we can easily restore our historic claims to the region and begin the process of forming a great Iranian nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
constitutional_assembly_gco_title;The Caracas Congress;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
constitutional_assembly_gco_desc;7 months ago, a group of brave Colombian patriots gathered in Caracas, declaring the Republic of Colombia as a nation of all Latin americans in the new world. Since then we managed to form a large army of militias, ready to fight for their liberty and independence from the Spanish crown, following the example of the Central American partisans of 1831. Now that we are in a position of power, let the new congress sign the declaration of independence and make our nation truly official.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
smol_capital_of_gco_title;The Capital Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
smol_capital_of_gco_desc;The war is over and our nation stands free and equal amongst the others of the world. We should pick our capital to finalize the formation of our new nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
jamtland_treaty_title;Treaty of Copenhagen;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
jamtland_treaty_desc;The border between Denmark-Norway and Sweden has been fluid for centuries now with territories going back and forth every few decades. However, the current border has persisted for over a century now. Although both sides claim the land of the other, it remains largely static and signing a treaty that confirms it could boost our diplomatic relations with the united kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
independence_referendum_nor_title;The Independence Referendum;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
independence_referendum_nor_desc;Norway has been part of Denmark since 1537. This 300 year long period saw a steady increase of the wealth, stability and security of both Denmark and Norway. However, with the rise of liberal and nationalist sentiment across europe, many voices have started to advocate for the recreation of an independent Norwegian state. Holding a referendum on the matter could allow us to achieve our independence through legal means or alternatively reinforce the authority of the union, leading to long lasting stability.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
independence_declaration_nor_title;Norwegian Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
independence_declaration_nor_desc;We have been under Danish rule for far too long. With our newly won strengt we must not accept the injustice imposed upon us by the Danish. The time has come for Norway to rise and reclaim its position on the international stage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
become_denmark_title;Become Denmark;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
become_denmark_desc;The Union is no more. With the dissolution of Denmark-Norway, holding onto these titles is all but obsolete. We must acknowledge the reality of the situation and regain our respect in the international community.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
ainu_expansion_title;Expand the Confederacy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
ainu_expansion_desc;In 1822, the first Ainu-Japanese War led to the formation of the Ainu Confederacy, a coalition of local Ainu tribes meant to defend the independence of Ezo. The majority of Ainu joined the Confederacy by 1825, however, many tribes still remain independent and weak to foreign aggression. We should invite them into the Confederacy and expand our reach.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
ainu_ultimatum_title;The Ainu Ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
ainu_ultimatum_desc;The Ainu Confederacy keeps expanding and only grows in strength with each passing day. The integration of Etorofu could very well only be the first step of the local tribes to start a general uprising in the north of Japan. As long as the tribes remain independent, the stability of the Emishi and all of Japan remains in danger. We should sent an ultimatum and demand the confederacy to join the Emishi or face the might of the Imperial Army.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
claim_the_phoenix_title;Claim the Phoenix;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
claim_the_phoenix_desc;The Territory of Phoenix, named after its largest settlement in the greater Mojave region, has been long disputed between Nouvelle France and Nueva España. French and Spanish settlers moved North into the territory for decades now, giving both sides an equal claim on the area. However, with our recent declaration of independence we have inherited the Spanish claim, thus we should act quickly and enforce our rule upon the Phoenix before the French do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
treaty_of_lima_title;Treaty of Lima;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
treaty_of_lima_desc;We endured for long enough. The Colombians have to recognize our independence and right to exist as a nation. No longer shall they claim our Northern Territories under the so-called Kapuyan Republic. Glory to the Picchun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
kapuyan_war_title;The Kapuyan Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
kapuyan_war_desc;The Picchuni have made significant losses and their administration is collapsing. Without holding any major city, their claim to the Andes is all but hot air. We are now in a position to enforce the Kapuyan Republic upon the Picchuni.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
royalist_victory_title;Victory for the King!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
royalist_victory_desc;The Civil War has been going for too long - the people are tired of war and the colonies are in anarchy. We hold all major cities across Spain and the Republicans are defeated. It is time to restore order to our nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
republican_victory_title;Victory for the Republic!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;

free_brazil_title;Liberate Brazil;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
free_brazil_desc;As the civil war in Spain continues and the ravaging anarchy in Brazil seemingly intensifies, the liberals of Brazil have begun forming their own militias and could, if we support them, form a provisional government and proclaim their independence from Spain. It would certainly be in our interest to end the Brazilian Campaign as soon as possible so we can focus on internal matters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
integrate_kapuy_title;Integrate Kapuy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
integrate_kapuy_desc;With the integration of Qutio, the Kapuyan Republic now lays right to our south as yet another satellite state. With the Kapuyan War over, it only makes sense to grand them statehood under in the Colombian Federation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
form_upca_brc_title;Form Centróamerica;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
form_upca_brc_desc;Despite all odds, Arce has managed to overthrow the national assembly and restore his rule over the whole of the Central America. It is time to reform Boruca into a proper federation and make the dream of a central american nation a reality.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
form_upca_title;Form Centróamerica;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
form_upca_desc;Our dominant position in Central America has enabled us to restore the old federation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
reform_upca_government_title;Abolish the Regions;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
reform_upca_government_desc;Decades have passed since the end of the Civil War and our people have embraced the Central American Identity of our nation. The various regions have become nothing more but a manifest of a time that has passed, a time in which Central America was disunited and fragile. Abolishing them would mark the end of a chaotic age in Central American history.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
integration_of_quito_title;Integrate Quito;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
integration_of_quito_desc;When the initial Declaration of Independence was proclaimed in Caracas, both Bogota and Buenos Aires quickly followed suit. However, Quito remained a stronghold for Spanish Loyalists. When Colombian troops entered the territory and occupied the city, the Republic of Quito was set up as a puppet government until it could be properly integrated into Colombia. Now that the war is over, the time has come to fully inherit their territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
conquest_of_santa_cruz_title;Conquest of Santa Cruz;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
conquest_of_santa_cruz_desc;Many settlers moved east, past the Andes, for decades now. It would only make sense to integrate these lands into our nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
conquest_of_maipurea_title;Conquest of Maipurea;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
conquest_of_maipurea_desc;The area inhabited by the Maipureans was always a dangerous and uncivilized spot in the center of the Amazon. But with the proper equipment and technology, even the resilient Maipureans shall fall to our country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
conquest_of_borba_title;Conquest of Borba;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
conquest_of_borba_desc;The plains and jungles of the lands up to Borba still lack a proper administration and is largely ruled by savage tribes. It is time to bring some order to these lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
conquest_of_trans_borba_title;Conquest of Trans-Borba;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
conquest_of_trans_borba_desc;With our rule firmly established over Borba, it is time to expand our domain over the remaining uncivilized territories of the Amazonas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
deal_with_galicia_spa_title;Border Negotiations with Galicia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
deal_with_galicia_spa_desc;At last, after nearly a decade of internecine conflict and revolution, the guns have fallen silent in Spain. Although the Monarchy has survived, it has been a close-run affair and the costs - political, economic, human - have been immense. The Galician Republic managed to affirm its independence in the midst of the revolutionary chaos, and for now our official position is that Galicia is an integral part of our Kingdom. However, due to the preacarious position of our Monarchy it might be best to recongise their independence - so long as they are willing to redraw the borders and give up Spanish-speaking Miranda'l Duero and Elvas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
deal_with_galicia_spc_title;Border Negotiations with Galicia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
deal_with_galicia_spc_desc;Although the revolution is finally triumphant, and the Antiguu Réxime has been finally toppled, the dream of a pan-Iberian Confederation of Brother Republics has dissolved in the face of the obstinate and fierce defence of the Galician people for its independence. An uneasy peace for now holds across our common frontier, and with populations on both sides of the border weary after years of revolution and civil strife, it might be wise to negotiate a Border Treaty so that we can officially recognise Galicia as a legitimate state while saving face and placating the all-powerful military establishment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
occupy_andorra_title;Ultimatum to Andorra;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
occupy_andorra_desc;Now that our border in the West with Galicia is secure, we can turn our attentions to the North-East, where Andorra - a tiny Pyrenean principality legacy of the Age of Feudalism - still retains its independence. Nominally, the suzerainty over Andorra has belonged to the Bishop of Urgell for over half a millennium, but with the triumph of the Republic and the subsequent abolition of the Feudal Privileges that claim has passed on to us. We should send an Ultimatum to Andorra, whose integration into our State would help foster loyalty for the young Republic in the Catalan provinces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
invite_sardinia_into_sicily_title;Propose Federation with Sardinia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
invite_sardinia_into_sicily_desc;Despite having a distinct culture and language, Sardinia has close historical ties with Sicily. Both were conquered by the Catalans between the XIII and XIV centuries, and  remained part of the Crown of Aragon until they were inhereted by the Spanish after the Union of the Iberian Monarchies. Now our peoples are finally free, after having thrown off both the Spanish yoke and the anachronistic notion of Divine Rule. However, with the young Italian republics still being fragile, the Republican dream might come to an early unless we join together in a Federation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
proclaim_the_sicilian_republic_title;The $YEAR$ Sicilian Constituent Elections;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
proclaim_the_sicilian_republic_desc;The years following the Neapolitan Revolution have not been easy for the Republic, menaced both by external enemies and internal turmoil as the forces of revolution and counterrevolution threatened to tear the new State at its seams. That the Republic made it through these troubled time is in no small part thanks to our President, to whom the Sicilian people gave quasi-supreme powers to keep the ship afloat. Now that the seas are calmer, our illustrious President has decided to step down, demonstrating the possession of civic virtue akin to that of the Cincinnatus of old. Constituent Elections are now underway to finally start an era of democracy for the Sicilian people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
aragon_rename_catalan_title;Rename the Vegueries;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;
aragon_rename_catalan_desc;The old Catalan administrative division of the Vegueries, although initially kept in place after the union with Llión, were eventually abolished and replaced with provinces drawn up in the Leonese manner during the absolutist phase of the late-Spanish Kingdom. Now that we have regained full independence, it's time to reorganise the administrative system and reinstate the Catalan Vegueries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;

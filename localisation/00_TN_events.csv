EVTDESC179200;In 1788, the British Parliament passed the Abolition of Slavery Act which intended to drastically cut down on the international slave trade and to eventually completely eliminate slavery alltogether - As a result, the catholic Anglo-Saxon populace of Tainody, during the final phase of the Franco-British War, already discontent with the primarily protestant and Welsh speaking government on the isle, seized the oppertunity and seceded from the British Empire, declaring the Tainodyn Republic in 1792. With most of the royal navy occupied elsewhere, the young republic managed to topple the island's government and established a segregationist republic of the slave holding elite. With the new Parliament divided between various factions of whom some wish to reclaim the british isles for the angles while others wish to build a white man's nation abroad, the future remains open for Tainody...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,

EVTDESC712406;Visegrad has served us well in the past: located on a hill overseeing the upper danube, the fort remained a major Slavic stronghold for centuries. However, the surrounding valley is barely able to accomodate for the growing populace and the geography is less than optimal to support a major city. As a result, many in our governemt advocate to relocate furter south to the town of Vacija where the land is more flat and already more populated than in our current capital.

EVTNAME990000;The Golden Century;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
EVTDESC990000;Once the Hegemon of the Middle East, the Mamluk Sultanate stagnated during the late 15th century as Europeans discovered a new route to  India via the Cabo. The foundation of the V-E Suez Canal Company brought new life into the  Sultanate as the canal has resulted in a blooming Indo-Mediterranean Trade. Even overseas the Sultanate established new trade posts that flourish and cultivate the international trade. But this expansion has also brought in new ideas from abroad that threaten the very foundations of the Sultanate itself. Especially cities like Alexandria are heavily influenced by Venice and house large communities of constitutionalists who wish to reform Egypt into a modern nation state. The 18th century was undoubtedly one of prosperity, but it becomes clear that new conflicts start to emerge as the Sultan has to find a balanced approach between appeasing reformers and reactionaries  alike.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,

EVTNAME990001;The Alexandrian Legation Quarters;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
EVTDESC990001;With trade flourishing in Alexandria, people from all over come to the city to engage in the commercial activities. The Venetians have a long history in Alexandria and have had their own Legation Quarters for almost three centuries now, but with an increasingly strong presence of Cymrians, French and Germans alike, the demand for the establishment of dedicated Legation Quarters for these foreigners has become rather strong. Establishing such may come at the dismay of the locals and venetians but could prove beneficial in further developing our international position.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,

EVTDESC990002;Slavery has long been practiced in europe and the islamic world alike. However, in recent years the issue of slavery has caused widespread division in western europe. Countries like Prydain or Spain even fought wars over its abolition with mixed results. Under Venetian Influence, a large part of the populace in Lower Egypt has grown rather dismissive of the continued practice of slavery within the Sultanate. While slavery within most of Egypt proper has fallen out of use, the East African Slave trade remains rather lucrative for us - With our recent reforms, the issue of the matter has been brought before Sultan and a decision over its future has to be made.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,

EVTDESC990003;After a century of prosperity, the Mamluk elite has failed to see the changing tides. Historians will argue over what caused the downfall of the Sultanate, but most likely a mixture of political stagnation, an entrenched conservative elite, an increasingly polarized populace as well as growing foreign influence have all contributed to the demise of Mamluk Sultanate. The Caliph has launched a coup with the support of the reactionary elements of the mamluk elite, re-establishing the Caliph's authority over the Nile. Following these events, the city of Alexandria seceded from the newly formed Caliphate, creating a new Egyptian Government led by the local Liberals and Christian Minority.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,

EVTDESC787807;In the aftermath of the chaotic declaration of independence, the majority of the Argentine Viceroyalty has fallen into the hands of the Colombian rebels. What remained of the Loyalists has fled into the territory of the Tawantinsuyu, leaving the provinces of Corrientes and Paraguay in the hands of the provincial government. In Asuncion, the government structure has largely collapsed, leaving the north in the hands of a newly formed Guarani Confederacy with the aim of throwing off the Spanish Yoke  entirely. We have to contain this anarchy and restore the provincial government as soon as possible if we wish to survive these turbolent times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,

A devout Paraguayanist, he has mobilized his troops and invaded the Chaco to secure it for the growing Paraguayan state. His intends are clear: to create a modern nationstate in the north, independent from both the Colombians and Platineans. Yet much works lays ahead of us - the native Guarani may have been defeated but form a large chunk of our population and have proven themselves to fiercly defend their independence. It might be most beneficial to properly integrate them into our newly emerging national identity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,

EVTDESC6666300;The Holy Roman Empire as an entity has lasted for a thousand years, acting as a hegemon over most of central and western europe. As much as it acted as a stabilizing force, so has it also brought much hardship and devastation in recent years as regional dukes and bishops lose control over their ever growing urban populace. Feudal structures and the rise of modern industrialism, combined with a weak central authority, economic hardship and deep religious divisions have increasingly destabilized and undermined the empire for centuries, resulting in the emperor becoming nothing more but a weak figurehead. At last has happened what was already well overdue: As Bohemia, the Hansa and Netherlands cut the remaining ties with Munich, the ruling Wittelsbacher see themselves unable to enforce the Imperial Law, unable to keep together a fracturing realm that is no longer meant to last. The princes no longer recognize the authority of the double-headed eagle, effectively rendering the empire void. At last, the true heir of Rome, with it's divine right to rule...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,

With the rise of nationalist sentiment, the calls for a unified language has emerged as well and many have turned towards the Tuscan, albeit a modified variant, to act as the universal Italian language due to it's already prestigeous status.

EVTNAME161100;The 7 days of Stockholm;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
EVTDESC161100;Sweden is usually seen as we wealthy and stable country, however, in recent years things took a drastic turn. In the aftermath of the Nordic War of 1829, Sweden was forced to recognize Danish control over Götenburg and secede large strips of land along the Swedish-Norwegian border. Furthermore, Danish and Norwegian armies spread havoc throughout Sweden, harming the economy and leaving behind a severely disenfranchised populace. In an attempt to restore order to the post-war country, Sweden has turned into an increasingly autocratic monarchy that sees itself unable to keep a firm grip over the nation. At last, popular discontent has reached an all-time high as liberal revolutionaries called for an armed uprising against the monarchy, resulting in 7 days of steet and barricade fighting in Stockholm that have finally concluded in favor of the government. However, this may very well only be the beginning of something more sinister to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,

EVTDESC161101;In the aftermath of the recent uprising in Stockholm, a wave of liberal agitation swept the country and created and increasingly hostile sentiment towards the Swedish monarchy. When an illegal gathering in Stockholm escalated in the aftermath of a police crackdown, much of the city joined the revolt with our troops being forced to pull out. As of right now, royalist militas are engaging in barricade fights throughout Stockholm against the revolutionaries while our troops prepare to invade just outside of the city boundaries. An armed intervention however would result in a high cost of lives and voices within our government have started to call for the King to abdicate and restore authority to a new parliament instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,

EVTDESC191800;In the aftermath of the Hussite wars, the heretical christian sects were eradicated for the most part and Bohemia enjoyed three centuries of stability thanks to the unifying catholic faith of the populace. In recent times however, a visible shift seems to have occurred as people become increasingly aware of the linguistic divide in our country. The German speaking populace of the Sudetenland and Silesia becomes more dissatisfied with the Czech dominated government in Prague while many Czechs see the unity of the realm threatened by possible secessionist groups in Eger and Breslau.

EVTDESC191802;Influenced by recent events elsewhere in Germany, nationalist agitation in the German lands of Bohemia has intensified, causing separatist sentiment to arise due to the Czech dominated government in Prague.

EVTDESC191803;Great Moravia was a union of various slavic entities that existed in what is today part of Moravia and Pannonia. Formed from the ruins of the first Avar Khaganate, Great Moravia dominated Bohemia and the Carpathian basin throughout the 9th century before disintegrating in the middle of the 10th century. While the Slavs of Moravia have long since evolved into the modern Czechs, Slovaks and Avars, the idea of a reunited Slovincian nation has recently gained traction as promiment patriotic clubs have sprung up from Praha to Vyšehrad to promote this Great Moravian Nationalism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,

EVTDESC191810;The Crown of Bohemia is arguably the hegemon of central europe and the main rival to the Wittelsbacher Empire. Following the the Hussite Wars in the 15th century, the current Rosenberg Dynasty of Bohemia firmly consolidated the Silesian and Lusatian Duchies and has greatly expanded the Bohemian realm to include much of Pannonia. Recently however, with the advent of nationalist sentiment following the Spanish Revolution, a rift appeared within Bohemia between the Czech lands of Bohemia-Moravia and the German Sudetes and Silesia. Furthermore, the politics of the Holy Roman Empire leave most of our domains in Pannonia outside our effective control and in the hands of the regional nobility, undermining the cohesion of the realm. In time we'll have to make a decision about the future of the Crown if we wish to preserve the Bohemian Hegemony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,

The Fall of Kyoto marked the end of the Imperial State of Japan, giving rise to the Kyoto Khanate in its place. A last ditch effort led by the great Hojo Clan managed to avoid the complete conquest of Japan, but left much of Japan in Mongol hands.

EVTNAME6666200;The Teutonic Knighthood;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
EVTDESC6666200;In the 1440's, a series of Prussian cities and bishoprics had united against the arbitrariness of the Teutonic Knighthood and by 1454 had launched a rebellion against the Teutonic State which saw the establishment of Hanseatic Hegemony over the Baltics following their intervention into the Prussian War. Ever since, Danzig served as the capital and primary hub of the region, serving as the power basis from which the Hanseatic League governs Prussia. But the Knights were not abolished as an entity following their defeat - While they initially kept many of their lands around Marienburg, their center eventually shifted towards Königsberg from where the reactionary Knighthood operates to this day, constantly undermining the Prussian Confederation. With the recent rise of the Livonian Brotherhood, it is only a matter of time before the Teutons attempt to seize power in Prussia as well, hence why we must contain them once and for all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,

EVTDESC6666201;Our attempts at limiting the knighthood were successful - we have seized their remaining lands in Prussia and elimated their reactionary influence of the better - The Confederation has prevailed! However, the issue of the Baltic Collapse and the steady decline of the Hanseatic League are the primary reasons why the knighthood become an issue in the first place - perhaps it is time to cut ties with the League and establish ourselves as an independent democratic state based on the ideals of the Spanish Revolution?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,

While Confederate troops managed to hold onto the Ermland, Pomerelle and Danzig itself, the situation appears bleak. The Confederation does not have the means to defeat the Teutonic State and aid from the League seems unlikely, thus many in the Danziger Hansetag have put forth the idea of capitulating outright before the situation escalates into civil war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,

EVTNAME078502;The Royal Election of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC078502;Poland has been an elective monarchy since the 16th century, meaning that the Polish nobility usually elects a new king upon the death or abdication of the previous one from among various european candidates. This unique arangement has kept Poland from succession wars born out of hereditary issues, but has also led to the country being easily influenced by outside powers. Since the mid 18th century, Poland has was traditionally ruled by members of the Wettin Dynasty of Saxony who greatly stabilized and enhanced the territory of the Polish Kingdom. Recent revolutionary developments in the West however have made the Sejm sceptical and worried that a Saxon Monarch could pull Poland into an undesired war in Western Europe. Thus a alternative proposal of electing a local Polish noble as King has become pretty attractive within a large faction of the Sejm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The previous decade has seen the rise and spread of Pan-Slavic Nationalism throughout much of the Kingdom. The Wettins have done a great job at ruling Poland in the past, thus many in the Sejm consider electing another Saxon King to keep the multi-ethnic character of our Kingdom. However, with Poland including much of Ruthenia, the election of a Polish noble to solidify and expand upon the Polish-Ruthenian Pan-Slavic ethos to strengthen our country seems reasonable as well. Alternatively, there have beeen new forces advocating for the election of a Bohemian King and for the development of a West-Slavic Nationalism specifically to further the polonization of the East.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

In these times, Afghanistan enjoyed a brief period of independence but by 1766 the Turkmen Hajilarids of Khorasan have managed to reunite the Safavid's former empire, extending their rule over much of Afghanistan as well. However, in recent years the constant wars against the Rûm have left the empire weakened and decentralized. A man by the name of Iqbal Nazari has used this oppertunity to unite the Pashtos of Kandahar and Pashtunistan under a single banner and is now preparing a potential uprising against Hajilarid Rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME251701;The Nazarid Revolt;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC251701;Afghanistan has been part of the Iranian Empires since the Safavid Era but has proven itself to be an extremely rebellious region. While the usually rebellious region of Kandahar has largely been quiet since the rise of the Sunni Hajilarid Dynasty, recent wars in the West against the rising Shahdom of Rûm has left much of Pashtunistan de facto independent. To our misfortune, this has now led to the rise of a new Pashto Dynasty under a man called Iqbal Nazari. We must restore order in the east swiftly before more regions threaten to secede from the empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC251702;With the fall of the last Nazarid Stronghold, all of Afghanistan has once again been subdued and reintegrated into Iran. In spite of this, we retain our de facto independence and while officially part of the empire, it is only a matter of time before another disaster strikes the central authority and we get out second chance at gaining independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Redirecting our troops back to the east to retake the area would escalate the conflict and put us in a two-front war. How should we procede?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC251706;For almost seven decades have the Hajilarids held hegemony over most of greater Iran and Iraq, bringing peace and stability to a region that was has been in anarchy for almost a century following the demise of the Safavids. However, the recent loss of Iraq to the Rûm as well as various uprisings throughout the empire such as the Nazirid Revolt have left the empire weak and destabilized. Increasing discontent from the largely shiite population has finally sparked the downfall of the empire as the administration in Khorasan and Fars has completely failed. In Sari, a provisional Tabaristani government has declared formed an independent republic - in Isfahan, a local Persian Dynasty has taken over and seized much of Fars and Kerman. The remaining territories have fallen to various rebel groups with the remnants of the Hajilarids retreating into Turkmenia proper.

EVTDESC290100;Months have passed since the initial declaration of independence. Our Colombian allies have made great gains further to the south, taking effective control of the whole Quitan Governate. However, our situation remains precarious - a lack of Colombian aid has allowed for Spanish Invasion to take place in the Gio Grande Territory and it becomes increasingly clear that we cannot count on their aid anytime soon. Tasked with formulating a provisional constitution, the matter of our future status remains unclear. Initially the whole of New Spain was to become a constituent part of the Colombian Republic, but recent developments have shown that Caracas won't be able to directly aid us in our struggles, thus many within the Conservative Wing proposed the formation of an independent Tarascan Republic instead. However, many within the Liberal Wing call for the unity of all Colombians and urge everyone to stay loyal to the revolution. The matter is up for the vote and ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTDESC222208;Brittany has been under French dominion for over 250 years now, however, with most of France in chaos, the local Breton elite has decided to take matters into their own hands and temporarily seceded from the rest of the country. As of right now, anti-revolutionary sentiment is widespread throughout Nantes with reactionaries demanding the Duke to support the French monarch in his struggle against the republicans. However, with Breton nationalism at an all-time high, there have been calls by the liberals to abolish the Duchy alltogether and to declare a Breton Republic, to completely cut ties with the rest of the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME160500;A Land across the Sea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC160500;The Viceroyalty of New Cambria, commonly known as Avalon, was established in 1712 when the colonies of Afalon and Elmet were united under a single administration. Since then the United Colonies have gradually grown and come to include lands such as those of Dyfed and Albama - However, the recent Franco-British war left much of North America devastated. While Avalon has largely been spared, increased taxation as well as revolts in the lands of Llyn Mawr have led to an increase in Anti-Colonial Sentiment, further reinforced by the completece secession of the Spanish colonies to the south. An increase in border conflicts with the German colonies to the North has furthermore caused the people abandon faith in the Cymrian administration and if not addressed soon, a conflict will most likely arise between the colonies and home isles. Either way, the future of Avalon remains open.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME777720;La Renaixença;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC777720;Free from the Spanish yoke, it is now time to decide the future of our nation. The first matter at hand should be the selection of a suited capital. Historically Barcelona served as such and would keep us politically closer to our French liberators but would greatly upset the Aragonese. The city of Zaragoza within the historical region of Aragon would make for an excellent alternative and would underline our independence from France as a sovereign nation. However, this could greatly upset the Catalans in return. A final option would be Valencia which would be most beneficial due to its large port and location - furthermore the area around Valencia was historically heavily mixed between Catalans and Aragonese and would thus be a compromise between both, however, these days the city houses a large Spanish minority and we would run risk of falling back into the Spanish sphere in the long run. Whichever we pick will decide the future course of our country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT777720A;We are Aragonese first and foremost. Zaragoza is our natural capital.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME135000;The Lithuanian Duchy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC135000;Formed in 1236, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania played a major role in the Baltics and Eastern Europe prior to its subjugation in 1384. Seen by many as the birthplace of Baltic nationalism, the Duchy has always been troublesome for the Baltenland administration - while de jure a part of the League's territory, the Lithuanian nobility has effectively been ruling the land independently for centuries now. Only minimal cooperation exists with the central government in Riga and any attempts to establish a proper administration in the area has historically only led to the Lithuanian Uprisings of 1401, 1449, 1521 and 1730. As the Baltic authority continues to decline and Polish influence grows in the area, local nobles have now effectively seceded from the territory entirely, hoping to gain their full independence with Polish aid. If we fail to restore order in the south, the situation could quickly spiral out of control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME135001;The Livonian Order;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC135001;The Livonian Brothers of the Sword are one of the most influential groups within the Baltenland. A military order that is responsible for the subjugation of the Letts, Ests and Kurs, the Livonians have largely been assimilated into the Teutonic Order by the 15th century. However, following the war of the Prussian Confederation and the subjugation of the Teutonic Knights by the Hanseatic League, the Livonian Order has been reformed in the aftermath of the formation of the Baltenland. While the knights historically haven't caused much trouble, the recent loss of the Lithuanian Duchy has allowed for the conservative and reactionary knighthood to once more establish their authority throughout much of the territory on the pretext of preserving German rule over the area. We must act soon and put a final end to the knights if we wish to preserve the league.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT135001A;We will prevail.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT135001B;The Knights will preserve what is left. Onwards as Livonia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME135002;The Baltic Collapse;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC135002;Rising tensions throughout the territory and a strong decline of the central authority in Riga has long troubled the Hanse's Baltic lands. What started as an act of defiance by the local Lithuanian nobility has quickly spiraled into the complete disintegration of the Baltenland as Livonian Knights and Lithuanian Nobles assert their rule throughout the land, effectively putting an end to centuries of Hanseatic Rule. While the city of Riga manages to fight off the Livonian's attempts to assert their rule, the Baltenland has now effectively seized to exist, leaving the Baltics in the hands of the local rulers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME135003;The Future of Riga;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC135003;The Baltic League is no more. In its place now stand the Lithuania Duchy, the Livonian Order and the Rigan Republic. Unlike the first two however, Riga is no more than a mere city state with only limited influence and power. While it is the largest city of the area, without Hanseatic aid it is unlikely that it will withstand the Livonian Knights for long. Alternatively, submitting to the Knighthood will cause tensions with the Hanseatic League in the future. Hence two camps have emerged, each favouring either the reactionary Knighthood or the liberal League. Alternatively we can try to form our own fate as an independent city state and a free republic of the Baltic. The decision is up to the Rigan Council.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT135003A;The Pearl of the Baltic shall be independent and free for evermore!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME145500;The Decline of Kyoto;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC145500;The Khanate of Kyoto has enjoyed a long period of peace and prosperity for the past five centuries, having been an extremely attractive place for Chinese refugees ever since the collapse of the Yuan. Being a last remnant of the Mongol Empire, Kyoto has endured despite never ending raids and subjugation attempts. The arrival of the Europeans however has changed many things as new ideas start to spread throughout the Khanate. The traditional openess of the Khans towards outsiders seems to have turned against them now as the ideas of the Enlightenment start to become popular amongst the Tunghai while the disenfranchised Japanese start to adopt a more nationalist sentiment against the Khanate. Increasde Manchu and Japanese raids alike have led to an increased autonomy of the provinces as the central authority fails to protect its domain. If kept unadressed, these problems might very well bring about the final demise of Kublai Khan's Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC996600;When the Central American Partisan War began, Manuel Xosé Arce was just one of many regional militia leaders fighting against the Spanish. While initially just a minor insurgency which's future would have been one of tragedy, the sudden rise of revolutionary sentiment across the Americas has enabled Arce to effectively take control over most of Central America. However, unlike most other revolutionaries, he stands strongly opposed to the Pan-Colombian dream, instead fighting for a united Central American Federation. This stance has caused a lot of tensions in the liberal dominated national assembly, eventually resulting in the December Coup of 1835. Unable to hold onto power, he gathered his followers and set up an exile government in San Xosé, the Regional Borucan Government for the Liberation of Central America, ready to march north to seize control once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

While the Belizean army was an ally during the Partisan Wars, they refused to join Arce's government once the Spanish yoke was overthrown. The political instability that followed after Arce fled south has kept us from establishing a proper government in the break-away region - however, now that the Insurgency has been dealt with, it is time to bring them into the fold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

However, unlike most other revolutionaries, he stood strongly opposed to the Pan-Colombian dream, instead attempting to solidify his own rule in Centróamerica. His unpopularity in the assembly has thus resulted in a coup last December, causing him to flee to San Xosé.

Under the leadership of a new great khan, referred to as the Zöld Khan, many people have instead started to head west towards the Polish lands, settling in a strip of land along the black sea to build themselves a new homeland there.

What started as a minor administrative reform based on demographics quickly escalated into mass deportations and outright genocide. While the upper volga region seems to have only been minorly affected, the mass disappearance of Magyar and Sybyrlar communities alike has led to widespread concerns amongst the international community. There have been reports of bodies appearing along the Volga shores as far south as Tsaritsyn, confirming the worst fears of many. The Magyars who fled decades ago are indeed to be considered the lucky ones as those who stayed behind have now been nearly eradicated in this widespread ethnic cleansing, permanently changing the Idel-Ural area for better or worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

However, at the same time people are rallying to the banner of the Great Yue who promise the establishment of a new dynasty never seen before in Chinese history. As anarchy reigns supreme in the west, the Hui of Qinghai and Gansu rally under the banner of the Hui dynasty, promising to claim the mandate for the faithful.

While this is certainly a moment to rejoice for us, it also a moment to mourn as the Habsburgs with their long history have finally come to an end.

EVTDESC222200;The Age of Absolutism is coming to an end. Feudalism is becoming obsolete as the Industrial Revolution spreads across Europe. However, many regimes are unable to adapt, fail to reform themselves to fit into this new age. While France managed to remain relatively stable, this seems to become increasingly difficult as liberal and nationalist agitation leads to widespread unrest in our kingdom. The fall of the Spanish Empire has shown to all of Europe that if not kept in check, this sentiment will lead to anarchy and chaos. We are now facing an immediate danger in our very own capital, Paris, as enraged peasants and craftsman parade through the streets and harass priests and nobles alike. Reports of violence have become more common, and if we fail to contain this soon, we might face a serious crisis not just in Spain, but at home as well..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

While we have secured the immediate area around Paris and increased our presence at Versaille, with the fall of the prison the revolutionaries are now armed and more dangerous than before, ready to advance against our troops.

EVTDESC3021840;The Chinese Empire under the ruling Zhou Dynasty has enjoyed great prosperity for the past 167 years. But as time moves on, old agreements and power structures have led to widespread corruption and an extremely decentralized state.

Alternatively, republicans within our nation urged us to recognize the Spanish Republic and to embrace the Pan-Colombian ideals in hope of ending the current war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTDESC10010100;Following the Spanish Revolution many republicans of Milan, joined by a large crowd of unhappy peasants, took it to the streets to protest against the autocratic government despite the ban on public meetings. When the police forces tried to dissolve the gathering, the violence escalated and the angry crowd stormed the duke's palace, publicly hanging the royal family and many of their loyalists. Following these events a provisional government of twelve "Captains and Defenders of Liberty" was elected, proclaiming the Second Ambrosian Republic. Although just a minor republic in northern Italy, many patriots and republicans see this as the first step towards a unified Italian state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTDESC90020900;It took many months but the Congress of Caracas finally proposed the final draft of the constitution. This constitution would guarantee a free press, freedom of assembly, universal voting rights and equality between all states of the union.

EVTDESC466466;The Revolution has failed. With North and South Colombia unable to connect, both territories become separate nations and the people of the Andes remain under the Feudal institutions the revolution tried to abolish. As the Kapuyan Republic loses its legitimacy, so do people begin to question to the legitimacy of Colombia. Reactionary forces are advocating for rejoining the Spanish Motherland while more Liberal factions try to promote a North Andean Federation.

Now that we are at peace, the time has come to deal with our internal matters.

EVTNAME121100;The Swedish-Danish Border Treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC121100;We received a proposal from the Swedish ambassador early this morning. Apparently the Swedish government is open to negotiate the border between the United Kingdom and Sweden. For the most part it the current border would remain in effect with only a few towns and villages being exchanged. Furthermore the Swedish embassy proposed that if we drop our claim on Øst-Trøndelag, the Swedish government in return would ratify our ownership over Göteborg. This would greatly boost our diplomatic relations in the future and open up further negotiations concerning Scandinavia, however, many in the world might see this as a weakness since we would give up a large chunk of land to the swedes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTNAME121102;Border treaty declined!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC121102;The Dano-Norwegian ambassador informed us that the border treaty has been declined. Apparently the Norwegians are not willing to give up Øst-Trøndelag by any means. This is a clear sign that the Dano-Norwegians will indeed attack us at some point in order to take our rightful land. However, this might be beneficial for us since we now have a valid reason to claim the entirety of Trøndelag as rightful Swedish land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTNAME121103;Norwegian Independence Referendum;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC121103;A Norwegian delegation has approached us and asked for the permission to hold a plebiscite within the Norwegian territories. Demands for independence have increased within Norway over the past few decades and holding this plebiscite can either firmly confirm our authority over Norway or lead to their actual independence. Either way, the referendum is also being called for by a large chunk of the Norwegian populace so refusing it could lead rebellious thought spreading across our northern territories.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTDESC11001;Cheerings crowds have gathered all over Norway to celebrate the referendum. Nationalist sentiment seems to truly manifest within our populace and many seem to support independence from Denmark.

EVTDESC11004;Although the parliament has no direct influence in the referendum, many politicians within parliament support either the unionist or nationalist cause. Nationalists hold speeches about the history of Norway as an independent kingdom, about it ability to prosper as an independent country and about the undemocratic process within the kingdom that leads to a one-sides Danish dominated union. Unionists on the other hand argue for the economic stability and prosperity the union provides as well as the economic and military benefits that grant our nation safety. Either way, these speeches lead to ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTDESC11011;The final vote counts are coming in but already the final results are clear. Over 80% of the people voted in favour of independence.

EVTDESC11014;The final votes have been counted with the result being clear: Only 47% voted "Ja" while 53% voted to remain with Denmark.

As the situation deteriorated, liberals at home have abused the widespread unrest and started occupying cities in the south, declaring the Spanish Republic centered at Toledo. While Royalists managed to hold the northern half of Hispania, the rest of the country has fallen into Republican hands.

Thus these rebels have established a provisional government and declared independence from the Crown. With that, our largest stronghold in the new world has fallen.

However, if we don't act quickly, this new government might get the time to legitimize itself on the international stage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPT777702A;We have more important matters to deal with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTNAME777703;The Galician Uprising!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC777703;Message has reached us that the garrison in Lisbon was overwhelmed by Galician Nationalists. Unable to reinforce our troops, the rebels have taken over the city and assembled their own militia. With most of our army occupied in the south, Portucale and Galicia proper have fallen into the rebel's hands. While this act of defiance towards the Crown is unacceptable, establishing another front in this war would mean our downfall. However, pulling out of the coastal counties would demoralize our troops and leave us humiliated in the eyes of the world...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPT777703A;We will deal with them later..;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPT777703B;Spain is indivisable! Down with the traitors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTNAME777704;The fall of Alentejo;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC777704;Message has reached us that the Galicians have launched an uprising against our rule. The Royalists were unable to hold the western provinces and allowed for the separatists to take over. Occupied with the enemy in the North, the Rebels have successfully taken Alentejo and Algarve. Invading would mean opening up another front which would certainly weaken our military capacity - However, these rebels are fellow Republicans. We could recognize their government for now and deal with them after the war as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPT777704A;We shall show solidarity with our Galician allies!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTNAME777705;The Italian Secession!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC777705;As the war in Hispania carries on, many of our overseas possessions fall into the hands of secessionists. Message has reached us now that the Neapolitans have declared independence from the Crown, quickly followed by a similar act of defiance on the island of Sardinia. If we don't put down these revolts anytime soon we might permanently lose our claims in Italy and set off a chain reaction that could mean the end of the Empire..;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPT777705A;We cannot afford yet another enemy..;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTNAME777706;The Neapolitan Revolution!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC777706;The Spanish Empire has fallen. Its colonies are in open revolt, the Galicians have seceded and now a group of brave Italian patriots have seized the oppertunity and declared the Neapolitan Republic, effectively taking control of most of the Spanish holdings in Italy. It is unlikely that the Spaniards can allocate the resources to intervene and as a result, our independence is all but certain. However, there are still many within our young republic who do not embrace the ideas of liberalism and republicanism, thus many in the provisional government have voiced their concerns to fully liberalize our society if it means risking a reactionary takeover.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPT777706A;The Republic must be free!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTNAME99660;Civil War in Central America!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC99660;The Grand Republic of Central America was always a troubled nation. Since the initial declaration of independence in 1833 the country saw a sharp divide between the Liberals of Guatemala and the Conservatives of Rivas. United in their struggle against the Spanish, the common enemy quickly faded out of view as Tarascania and Avalon revolted in late '35. Unable to agree on how the provisional government should transition, the stalemate between both factions deepened before eventually both sides formed their own militias and began occupying cities in the North and South respectively, thus marking the beginning the Central American Civil War. With the further formation of Jacobine Rebels in the countryside, the nation is now truly in anarchy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

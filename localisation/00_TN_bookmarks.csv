RE_NAME;The Colonial Wars;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
RE_DESC;The Treaty of Madrid has been signed, finally bringing an end to the North American War. While Spain and Cymru saw the acquisition of vast new territories, they are leaving behind a broken and revanchist French Empire. Both Cymru and Spain are in crippling debt and the new world lays devastated. With the further exploitation of the colonies and the high taxation without representation, many disillusioned radicals have started uprisings across central and south america, possibly marking the beginning of the end to the end the vast colonial empires of europe.. - As the situation in the colonies deteriorates, liberals in europe sense their chance to rally the peasants at home and overthrow the monarchies of europe while the feudal states are weak and unstable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
GC_NAME;The Age of Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
GC_DESC;Following the period known as the Colonial Wars, most colonies in the New World have managed to gain their independence from the Spanish Crown. Disloyalty rises amongst the Cymrics in America as colonial disputes intensify and Colombian agitators call for an end of the injustices. Meanwhile, liberals at home have thrown the Spanish homeland into chaos, starting the Spanish Civil War. As Spain sinks further into anarchy, liberal movements across Europe take up their chance to overthrow their autocratic rulers. While reactionary powers try to contain the uprising, it becomes clear that the Ancient Regime will soon be gone, either by being violently abolished or by reforming itself, leading into a new modern age.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
